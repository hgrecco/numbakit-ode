numbakit-ode: leveraging numba to speed up ODE integration
==========================================================

   :class: floatingflask


numbakit-ode (nbkode) is a Python package to solve
**ordinary differential equations (ODE)** that uses
Numba_ to compile code and therefore speed up calculations.

The API is very similar to scipy's integrate module therefore
allowing for easy migration.

It runs in Python 3.7+ depending on NumPy_, SciPy_ and Numba_.
It is licensed under BSD.

.. testsetup::

        import nbkode

It is extremely easy and natural to use:

.. doctest::

    >>> import nbkode
    >>> def func(t, y):
    ...     return -0.1 * y
    >>> t0 = 0.
    >>> y0 = 1.
    >>> solver = nbkode.ForwardEuler(func, t0, y0)
    >>> ts, ys = solver.run([0., 5., 10.])

You can get a list of all solvers:

.. doctest:: python

    >>> import nbkode
    >>> nbkode.get_solvers() #doctest: +SKIP

or filter by characteristics or group name (or names).

.. doctest:: python

    >>> nbkode.get_solvers(implicit=False, fixed_step=True) #doctest: +SKIP
    >>> nbkode.get_solvers('euler', 'adams-bashforth') #doctest: +SKIP


Quick Installation
------------------

To install numbakit-ode, simply (*soon*):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install numbakit-ode

or utilizing conda, with the conda-forge channel (*soon*):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge numbakit-ode

and then simply enjoy it!

Design principles
-----------------

**Fast**: We love Numba_. It allows you to write clean Python code
that translates to optimized machine code at runtime. We aim to
be able to leverage this power to solve a system of ordinary
differential equations.

**Simple but useful API**: Solvers are classes easy to instantiate,
with sensible defaults and convenient methods.

**Correctness**: We check against established libraries like SciPy_
that our implementation match those of established libraries using
automated testing.

**Data driven development**: We take decisions based on data, and for this
purpose we measure the performance of each part of the package, and the effect
of each change we make.
