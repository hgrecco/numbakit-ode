========

Follow the steps below and learn how to use numbakit-ode to solve a system of
ordinary differential equations. The API is very similar to SciPy integrate
module so you will be up to speed in a blink.

.. testsetup::

        import nbkode
        import numpy as np


Solving a simple equation
-------------------------

Let's solve an equation. Consider as simple differential equation

.. math::

    \frac{dy}{dt} = -0.1 \, y

Let's write the right hand side of the equation in Python

.. doctest::

   >>> def rhs(t, y):
   ...     return -0.1 * y

A few important things:

1. The first argument has to be the time (even if you do not use it).
2. The second argument has to be the variable and accept a numpy array.

Let's integrate this equation using a **RungeKutta45** to a set of specific
time points, with `1` as the initial value.

Always pass t0 as a parameter in the methods even if it is not required.

.. doctest::

   >>> y0 = 1.
   >>> t0 = 0
   >>> solver = nbkode.RungeKutta45(rhs, t0, y0)
   >>> ts = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
   >>> ts, ys = solver.run(ts)

and that's it. You can plot this result:

   >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   >>> plt.plot(ts, ys) #doctest: +SKIP

A solver instance remember and therefore the following command will not
recalculate the what has happened between 0 and 10.

   >>> ts2 = np.linspace(20, 40, 100)
   >>> ts2, ys2 = solver.run(ts2)
   >>> plt.plot(ts2, ys2) #doctest: +SKIP

You can do this as many times as you want, as long as you move forward
in time. Notice that in the first run, we integrated from 0 to 10. While in
the second from 20 to 40. The solver automatically integrated from 10 to 20
when `run` was called the second time.s

It is important to consider that the chosen time points might not match the
ones defined by the integration algorithm, nbkode interpolates to the values
you have provided. This is usually what you need. However, if you want to
integrate and get the steps without interpolation just can call `step`:

.. doctest::

   >>> y0 = 1.
   >>> t0 = 0
   >>> solver = nbkode.RungeKutta45(rhs, t0, y0)
   >>> ts, ys = solver.step(n=10) # You can also use upto_t here to step until a given time.

and and again. You can plot this result.

   >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   >>> plt.plot(t, y) #doctest: +SKIP


Notice that the points are more sparse. They are also unevenly distributed
because RungeKutta45 is a variable step integrator.

Finally, you can use the `skip` function if you want to calculate until
a specific time without storing the intermediate results

   >>> y0 = 1.
   >>> t0 = 0
   >>> solver = nbkode.RungeKutta45(rhs, t0, y0)
   >>> solver.skip(upto_t=10) # You can also use n here to skip a number of steps.
   >>> print(solver.t) #doctest: +SKIP

At any time, you can find out the current time, variable and rhs.

    >>> print(solver.t, solver.y, solver.f) #doctest: +SKIP


.. note::
    `step` and `skip` are related functions as they integrate forward until
    a certain condition is met. The main difference is that while `step`
    returns the time and state arrays, `skip` does it without keeping and
    returning the results and therefore is faster and memory efficient
    when those values are not needed.
    They both take the same keyword only arguments: `n` and `upto_t`.
    The first indicates the number of steps to advance and the second
    the integration time point that it will not go beyond.


Parameters
----------

If your right hand side contains an explicit parameter:

.. doctest::

   >>> def rhs(t, y, p):
   ...     return p * y

and you do not want to elide it, the value can be given provided to
the integrator.

.. doctest::

   >>> y0 = 1.
   >>> p = -0.1
   >>> t0 = 0
   >>> solver = nbkode.RungeKutta45(rhs, t0, y0, params=p)
   >>> ts = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
   >>> ts, ys = solver.run(ts)


More than one equation
----------------------

If there more than one equation,

.. math::

    \frac{dy_1}{dt} &= -0.1 \, y_1

    \frac{dy_2}{dt} &= -0.5 \, y_2

you just need to make sure that the output of the rhs is a numpy array.

So this is ok:

   >>> def rhs(t, y):
   ...     return np.asarray([-0.1 * y[0], -0.5 * y[1]])

but this is not ok (as the output is a tuple):

   >>> def rhs(t, y):
   ...     return -0.1 * y[0], -0.5 * y[1]

This is also ok (and also more elegant):

   >>> def rhs(t, y, p):
   ...     return p * y

and it can be combined with the `params` argument,

.. doctest::

   >>> y0 = [1., 2.]
   >>> p = [-0.1, -0.5]
   >>> t0 = 0
   >>> solver = nbkode.RungeKutta45(rhs, t0, y0, params=p)
   >>> ts = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
   >>> ts, ys = solver.run(ts)



What's available
----------------

Before using numbakit-ode, you can check what solvers are implemented:

.. doctest::

   >>> import nbkode
   >>> nbkode.get_solvers()
   (<AdamsBashforth1>, <AdamsBashforth2>, <AdamsBashforth3>, <AdamsBashforth4>, <AdamsBashforth5>, <AdamsMoulton1>, <AdamsMoulton2>, <AdamsMoulton3>, <AdamsMoulton4>, <AdamsMoulton5>, <ForwardEuler>, <BackwardEuler>, <BDF1>, <BDF2>, <BDF3>, <BDF4>, <BDF5>, <BDF6>, <Runge2>, <Runge3>, <Heun3>, <RungeKutta4>, <RungeKutta3_8>, <RungeKutta23>, <RungeKutta45>, <DOP853>)

Each element of this tuple is a class,

You can filter the output to list only those with fixed steps

.. doctest::

   >>> nbkode.get_solvers(fixed_step=True)
   (<AdamsBashforth1>, <AdamsBashforth2>, <AdamsBashforth3>, <AdamsBashforth4>, <AdamsBashforth5>, <AdamsMoulton1>, <AdamsMoulton2>, <AdamsMoulton3>, <AdamsMoulton4>, <AdamsMoulton5>, <ForwardEuler>, <BackwardEuler>, <BDF1>, <BDF2>, <BDF3>, <BDF4>, <BDF5>, <BDF6>, <Runge2>, <Runge3>, <Heun3>, <RungeKutta4>, <RungeKutta3_8>)

or those which are explicit:

.. doctest::

   >>> nbkode.get_solvers(implicit=False)
   (<AdamsMoulton1>, <AdamsMoulton2>, <AdamsMoulton3>, <AdamsMoulton4>, <AdamsMoulton5>, <BackwardEuler>, <BDF1>, <BDF2>, <BDF3>, <BDF4>, <BDF5>, <BDF6>, <Runge2>, <Runge3>, <Heun3>, <RungeKutta4>, <RungeKutta3_8>, <RungeKutta23>, <RungeKutta45>, <DOP853>)

or those of a given group:

.. doctest::

   >>> nbkode.get_solvers("euler")
   (<ForwardEuler>, <BackwardEuler>)

or groups:

.. doctest::

   >>> nbkode.get_solvers("Adams-Bashforth", "Euler")
   (<AdamsBashforth1>, <AdamsBashforth2>, <AdamsBashforth3>, <AdamsBashforth4>, <AdamsBashforth5>, <ForwardEuler>, <BackwardEuler>)

To get a list of the groups:

.. doctest::

    >>> nbkode.get_groups()
    ('Adams-Bashforth', 'Adams-Moulton', 'BDF', 'Euler', 'Runge-Kutta')
